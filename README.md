## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

### Backend (`backend/.env`)
Create a file named `.env` in the `backend` folder with the following content:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/codecanvas
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
```

- **MONGODB_URI**: Uses local MongoDB storage. Make sure MongoDB is running on your machine.
- **PORT**: The port your backend will run on (default: 3000).
- **JWT_SECRET**: A secret key for signing JWT tokens. **Generate a strong key using:**
  ```sh
  node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
  ```
  Copy the output and paste it as the value for `JWT_SECRET`.

### Frontend (`frontend/.env`)
Create a file named `.env` in the `frontend` folder with the following content:

```
VITE_JUDGE=https://emkc.org/api/v2/piston/execute
VITE_API_URL=https://alfa-leetcode-api.onrender.com
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

```
